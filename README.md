# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance

Project done by **Angelin Grace Vijaya, Pratham Agarwala, Shivangi Krishna**.

## Business Objective 

* HR Analysis tool for companies especially those with large workforce.
* Help companies to be prepared for future employee-loss 
* To find possible reasons for employee attrition, in order to prevent valuable employees from leaving.
* Predicting employee’s Performance Rating and hence distributing the employees into two classes
 ( 0 : Low Performance Rating, 1 : High Performance Rating)
* Accordingly, predict the employees “Percent Salary Hike”  for the next working term.


## Dataset Source:
* Kaggle Dataset by pavansubhash
* Fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists
* Contains 35 columns and 1470 records
* No missing values

## Acknowledgement


We would like to acknowledge and express our gratitude towards our Professor Dr. Sourav Sen Gupta for giving us this opportunity to hone our skills and for constantly supporting in the best possible way.

## Flow of our Notebook
Our notebook is roughly divided into 5 segments to complete our goal for this project.

1. First part mainly involves Data cleaning and General Exploratory Data Analysis for all the variables in the dataset to study them in depth.
2. Then we start with Machine Learning models to predict Attrition of the employees and this part also involves encoding and Data balancing.
3. After models we use the models and other necessary mediums to study the Attrition of employees and find the reasons of it.
4. Fourth part involves predicting the performance rating of the employees and these predicted values are stored to predict the expected Percent Salary hike of respective employees and for the next working term.
5. This involves studying the Monthly Income and finding the variables that most affects the employee's Monthly Income.
